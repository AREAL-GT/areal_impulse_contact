# AREAL Impulse-Based Contact Model

This package contains the implementation of the impulse-based contact model originally proposed by Mirtich and Canny. It is designed so that it can be added to any dynamic model whose pose is represented in a standard format. All information is given in the documentation page(s) below.

It is currently under construction, please contact Adam Garlow (adamgarlow@icloud.com) with any questions.
